This program (in-progress) teaches and helps one practice how to count cards
in Black-jack (also known as 21) using the hi-lo counting method. This program
was inspired by the movie 21. To use it, the user is prompted to enter the
number of cards they'd like to be dealt. The cards (suit and number) will be
shown in System.out, and then the user will be prompted to enter what they
think the count is at. If they are correct, the program will say so and begin
again. If they are wrong, then the program will say the correct answer, show
how the count was reached, and then restart.

Near-future updates:
1. Exception handling for when user enters invalid input
2. Graphical interface
3. Optimization

Long-term goals:
1. All-in-one black-jack trainer (basic strategy, card counting, etc.)
