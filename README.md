# card-counter
Program to help teach and practice counting cards.

This program (in-progress) teaches and helps one practice how to count cards in Black-jack (also known as 21) using the hi-lo counting method. This program was inspired by the movie 21. To use it, the user is prompted to enter the number of cards they'd like to be dealt. The cards (suit and number) will be shown in System.out, and then the user will be prompted to enter what they think the count is at. If they are correct, the program will say so and begin again. If they are wrong, then the program will say the correct answer, show how the count was reached, and then restart.

Near-future updates:

Exception handling for when user enters invalid input
Graphical interface
Optimization
Long-term goals:

All-in-one black-jack trainer (basic strategy, card counting, etc.)
